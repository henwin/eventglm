Description: A user friendly, easy to understand way of doing event history regression 
    for marginal estimands of interest, including the cumulative incidence and the 
    restricted mean survival, using the pseudo observation framework for estimation. 
    The interface uses the well known formulation of a generalized linear model and allows
    for features including plotting of residuals, the use of sampling weights, and corrected
    variance estimation.
